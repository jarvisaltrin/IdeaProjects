/*
Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing k samples from
a list of n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically n is large enough
that the list doesnâ€™t fit into main memory. For example, a list of search queries in Google and Facebook.

So we are given a big array (or stream) of numbers (to simplify),
and we need to write an efficient function to randomly select k numbers where 1 <= k <= n.
Let the input array be stream[].
